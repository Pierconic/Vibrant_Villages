It's always bothered me that villager mechanics essentially encourage what amounts to kidnapping and enslaving the cute little guys... so this mod essentially lets you summon villagers using a custom Deed Box, dismiss villagers in a less murderous fashion, and earn gifts from villagers if they've got decent mobility, proximity to other villagers, access to water, a sense of security, and well decorated surroundings- essentially encouraging players to go for a sort of 'free range' villager approach over trading halls, which are stupid. 
Also applies random names to villagers, and, with Optifine or Polytone enabled, borrows the random villager skins from Mindthemood's Misselaneous resource pack, for more variety.
